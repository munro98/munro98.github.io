This page displays various Javascript demos I have created over the years. Most of these demos use vanilla js since it keeps the demos simple and easy to understand while being able to be self contained in a single html document and all that is needed is a modern web browser.

A neat algorithm for rendering Pseudo 3D game worlds with no overdraw and without use of a Z-buffer

Quadtree
A neat data structure used for fast 2D collision queries. Works by spatialy dividing space into quadrants
