This page displays various Javascript demos I have created over the years. Most of these demos use vanilla js since it keeps the demos self contained and easy to understand while being able to be self contained in a single html document and all that is needed is a modern web browser.

# 2.5D renderer [(demo)](https://munro98.github.io/JSDemos/SectorRenderer.html)
Bisqwits 2.5D renderer
A neat algorithm for rendering Pseudo 3D game worlds with no overdraw and without use of a Z-buffer

# Quadtree [(demo)](https://munro98.github.io/JSDemos/QuadTree.html)
A neat data structure used for fast 2D collision queries. Works by spatialy dividing space into quadrants and only checking collisions against nearby objects. This is used in my game 9 Days.

# AABB Tree [(demo)](https://munro98.github.io/JSDemos/AABBTree.html)
A dynamic data structure for collision queries working by sorting the elements into herarchacal pairs of bounding boxes in a binary tree.

# Boids [(demo)](https://munro98.github.io/JSDemos/Boids.html)
A simple algorithm for simulating crowd movement useful for interactive games.

# Conways Game of Life [(demo)](https://munro98.github.io/JSDemos/ConwaysGameOfLife.html)
A facinating demo showcasing emergent behaviour from a simple set of rules and instructions letting us question the nature and meaning of life. Refresh to reset the simulation.
