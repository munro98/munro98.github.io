3D Multiplayer Minigolf

Technologies: Unity3D, C#

Software: Blender3D

This project was an exercise in learning about more game development in which I developed the gameplay, physics of how the golf balls interacted and also 3D modelling of the environment made for a full-on experience in game design. The challenge of syncing game state over the network while also pushing my 3D modelling skills made for a very interesting and fun project.
